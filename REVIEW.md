# Review for your malagasy app

_If you have any questions regarding the review, please come see me._

To explain the grading for each individual component, please see comments in those files.
General Issues:

1. Instead of duplicating styles think about how to combine them
2. remove console.logs and unused code and imports
3. Pay attention to spelling mistakes! Companies won't be happy about them. There are VSCode extensions that can help you with that
